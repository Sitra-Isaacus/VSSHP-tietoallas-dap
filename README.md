# VSSHP-tietoallas-dap

This repository consists of a snapshot (2018-01-18) of the 
VSSHP Data Analytics Platform Wiki.

The language of the Documentation is mixed Finnish and English, since
the clinical terminology in the source system tends to be in Finnish,
whereas the computational framework itself is aimed for wider
audience.

The original Wiki consists of separate Markdown-formatted text files
which are versioned under Git. For and introduction to Markdown, see
[Daring Fireball's Markdown Tutorial](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). For convenience, we have included only the compiled pdf generated with
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) by running *getbook.sh* at the Git
document root. The compilation script is included as an example.
